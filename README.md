# 🛍️ Customer Purchase Intention Prediction

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a user is likely to complete an online purchase based on browsing behavior and session attributes. It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on unseen data.

## 📘 Notebook

- `Project.ipynb` — Main notebook containing code for:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Cleaning and preprocessing
  - Model building and evaluation
  - Predictions on unseen/test data

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset)
- **Features**: Clicks, page durations, bounce rate, exit rate, and visitor types
- **Target**: `Revenue` (whether the visitor completed a purchase)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
